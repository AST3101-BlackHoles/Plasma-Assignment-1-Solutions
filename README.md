## Problem 1

>> Compute the trajectory for ballistic motion in the Rindler metric.
>> 
>> ```math
>> ds^2 = - (ax)^2 dt^2 + dx^2
>> ```

## Problem 2

>> Compare the orbital energy of a point particile in a circular orbits for Newtonian gravity and the Schwarzschild metric.
>> Which has a larger rate of change with the orbital radius?
>> How would this impact the evolution of a compact binary coalescence?
